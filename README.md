Last summer, I developed a strong interest in chess. I was particularly fascinated with the game's origins in India and how it has spread globally. I was also intrigued by how chess can be seen as a metaphor for life, as it often requires making strategic choices to reach an ultimate goal. What made the game even more challenging was the endless possibilities for each move, making it important to think critically when countering an opponent's moves. All in all, my experience with chess was eye-opening and helped me develop a deeper appreciation for the game's complexity.

I created a chess game using Java that provides an interactive experience for users. The game is designed to be terminal-based, allowing players to input the coordinates for their desired moves. The game features all of the classic chess pieces and is designed to be challenging, with players having to carefully plan their moves to counter their opponents. With this chess game, players can enjoy the strategic gameplay of chess in a convenient and user-friendly way.
